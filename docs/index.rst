Whether you are a new user installing PC Matic for the first time, or a returning user reinstalling after a system change, this guide walks you through each step in the process.

This documentation covers installation on Windows systems primarily, but also addresses mobile device and macOS installations, account login procedures, license recognition, and troubleshooting for common issues during the installation process.

System Requirements
-------------------

Before beginning installation, it is important to ensure your device meets the basic system requirements:

- A computer running a compatible version of Windows or macOS
- Administrative privileges on the device
- A functioning internet connection
- Adequate free disk space
- No conflicting antivirus programs installed

It is also recommended to disable any firewalls or security software temporarily during installation, as they may interfere with setup.

Step One: Locate or Download the Installer
------------------------------------------

If you have already purchased PC Matic, you need to access the installer. This may come in one of two forms:

- Navigate to the PC Matic login page
- Enter your registered email address and password
- Locate the “Downloads” section in your account

---------------------------

Once the installer has been downloaded successfully:

Once the necessary preferences have been confirmed, the software will begin installing on your system. This may take a few minutes depending on your system speed.
